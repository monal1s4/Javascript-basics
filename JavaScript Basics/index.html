            <p>JavaScript Basics
                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for
                a variety of reasons. Itis a small and
                allowing lightweight language maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different
                directions. JavaScript lives inside a host
                environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to
                provide programmatic control over
                them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><u><span class="color-acento">Variable Declaration</span></u> JavaScript variables are containers
                    for storing data values - imagine a
                    cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,
                    a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These
                    unique names are called identifiers.<span class="color-destacado"> var x;</span> </li><br>
                <li><u><span class="color-acento">Variable Assignment</span></u> operators assign values to JavaScript
                    variables - our cup can now have
                    coffee poured in it, giving our
                    variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable,<span
                        class="color-destacado"> var x = 10</span>;</li>
                <br>
                <li><u><span class="color-acento">Data Types</span></u> Data types are an important concept; to be able
                    to operate on variables you need to
                    know the data type. There are six data types
                    that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="color-destacado">true</span> or <span
                        class="color-destacado">false;</span> null - <span class="color-destacado">null</span> aka
                    nothing; Number - <span class="color-destacado">42</span> or
                    <span class="color-destacado">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="color-destacado">"Coding Dojo
                        Rocks!"</span>
                    Array -<span class="color-destacado"> [1,'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object -<span
                        class="color-destacado"> (first_name: ane', last_name: 'Doe')</span>
                </li><br>
                <li><u><span class="color-acento">Conditionals</span></u> When you write code, you want to perform
                    different actions for different
                    decisions - hitting different code blocks based on
                    values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to
                    accomplish this. There are the following
                    conditional statements:<span class="color-destacado"> if</span> a specified condition is true, do
                    this code in our code block;<span class="color-destacado"> else if</span> to
                    specify a new condition to test, if the first
                    condition is false;<span class="color-destacado"> else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
                <br>
                <li><u><span class="color-acento">Loops</span></u> There are many different kinds of loops in every
                    programming language, but they all
                    essentially do the same thing: they will repeat
                    an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four
                    times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li><br>
                <li><u><span class="color-acento">Function</span></u> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block.
                    When we call our function this will
                    run that code block. Think ofit as a list of
                    instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the
                    instruction manual and get started, first we
                    screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our
                    instructions. Sadly there are a ton more
                    tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
